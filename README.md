This file is to be run in an IDE that supports C# - I used Visual Studios.

A "tweet" string is given, and the program runs tests to check for various occurrences of letters, characters, and numbers.
It checks for mentions and topics (privy to a Twitter "tweet"). The concrete tweet "@franky goes to #Hollywood!1!" used in this program contains 1 mention and 1 topic, so the program checks if this is accurate. If so, the program will print true.

Unfortunately, while the HW 1 sheet does say not to include a main, I did to get the tests to run for this draft. It will be fixed within a couple of days.
